Here we generate a random maze. Do you see a path from the start, X, to the goal, G?
(Making only moves North, East, South, West). The search algrithm within is

On the matter of search,
<em>Dijkstra's Algorithm</em>
is inferior to a simpler and more effiecient search algorithm:
<em>Uniform Cost Search</em>.
(See this <a href="http://www.bgu.ac.il/~felner/2011/dikstra.pdf">position paper</a>).
Uniform Cost Search is an uninformed search algorithm that explores a search space
in the same way Dijkstra's does.

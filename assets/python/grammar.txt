A context free grammar <em>g</em> is a set of recursive rules that
describes a set of strings that constitute a language <em>L(g)</em>. If a
given string <em>s</em> can be generated by the grammar rules, then
<em> s &isin; L(g)</em>. More information about the formal definition can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar#Formal_definitions">here</a>.
Note that the "context free" simply indicates that the left hand side of each
rule does not depend on a context and, no matter the symbols surrounding it,
can always be replaced with the symbols on the right hand side.

We can use some rules from English grammar to define our own formal grammar.
Consider, how expressive is this language? Think about the range of expressions
that can possibly be generated. Note that it is infinite, so could theoretically
be encoded to express any possible finite amount of information.

Linguistics assumes compositionality of
language. The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compositionality/">
principle of compositionality</a> says that the meaning of any expression is determined
by the structure and meaning of its constituents. If some language is
not compositional, can we construct a CFG to model it?

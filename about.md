Greetings, my name is Leo Mehr.
I study the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications (see <a style="border:none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"><img class="embedded-img" src="/images/wikipedia_globe.png" /></a>) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). It is a beautiful place, at the right times.

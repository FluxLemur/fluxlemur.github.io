Greetings, my name is Leo Mehr.
I graduated with a BS in the scientific and practical approach to computation
and its applications (<a style="border:none"

src="/images/wikipedia_globe.png" /></a>) from
[Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) in 2016.

I now live in NYC and build software at [Hudson River
Trading](http://www.hudson-trading.com/).

## Why blogging?

Well, what even is blogging?

It's to "add new material to or regularly update a blog", according
to Google. How informative, thanks Google... But, in its defense, Google does
provide the origin of the word. It comes from "weblog":
_from web in the sense ‘World Wide Web’ and log in the sense ‘regular record of incidents.’_

So there we have it in it's most basic form: writing regularly on the internet.
You might realize we now have a conflation of two different questions in
"why blogging?":

- Why write at all?
- Why post it on the internet?

I think it's important to realize that there can only be two possible
answers, in essence
(if you're really rigorous, you could claim it's either 1 or 2; it makes for an
interesting debate,
[Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-human-nature-fundamentally-selfish-or-altruistic),
[Time](https://healthland.time.com/2012/10/08/is-human-nature-fundamentally-selfish-or-altruistic/)):

1. for others
2. for yourself

But, obviously, those are rather meaningless answers in themselves.
Perhaps most people will answer "for myself", and the people that
don't are trying to sell you a product or service? But more likely it is not
so; there certainly are people who genuinely try to make good content for
others.

Ideally, you can aim for both!

## Why write
There are some
[great benefits](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-reasons-you-should-write-something-each-day.html)
to writing often.
Two that I value are:

1. developing communication skills,
2. exploring interests (and potentially helping you discover them)

### Communicating
My middle school, the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School, gave
out a monthly writing award. Each time our principal came to the winner's class
to give the very same exhortation, saying: science and math will do you nothing
if you cannot communicate!!

Communication's importance cannot be understated,
from [Aristotle](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html),
to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/topic/communication)
(particularly noteworthy,
[this HBR article](https://hbr.org/1998/05/the-necessary-art-of-persuasion)).

One useful application of this theoretical construct "communication" is _marketing_.
Jeff Atwood writes how marketing is
[exceedingly useful](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-one-thing-every-software-engineer-should-know/)
for the engineer, that even the most amazing code isn't relevant until:

1. people understand what you're doing
2. people become interested in what you're doing
3. people get excited about what you're doing

### Exploration
A personal example: I didn't know much about html, js, css until making this website,
or about grammars until I tried to
[explain them](https://fluxlemur.github.io/posts/2015/03/24/grammar.html).

Also, personal projects grow. A single idea naturally flourishes into a
tree of possibilties and potential improvements.

## Why post on the internet

- Asked why he blogs, Jeff Atwood [writes](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/):

_Mostly for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of software
development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research
things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post,
which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find
these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting._

- There's no better way to remember something than to try to explain it cogently.

- Your blog is like an old attic. Just as you may find a dusty forsaken
Gameboy Advance 5 years from now, so too you'll find your old blog posts.

- It's cool to make interactive things for other people to enjoy. Below is

## Onward!

A couple great blogs I've found (that happen to be tech-bent) are from
[Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants)
(his older site), [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), and
[Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/).

I urge you to go write, post things on the internet, or better yet, both!
There are places to easily get started like
[Medium](https://publishers.medium.com/),
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com),
[750 words](https://750words.com/)), and many more one search away.
Challenge yourself, it's worth it.

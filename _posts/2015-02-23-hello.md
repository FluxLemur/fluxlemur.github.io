## Hello World

I am pleased that this website is now [quite
operational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGwDwx10wB4).
I plan on using it to explore various ideas and to learn
aspects of building a website. For more background,
see the [about](/about.html) page.


## Why FluxLemur

"FluxLemur" is a wonderful combination of an
applied math concept, "the flow of a physical property in space"
([Flux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux)), and the majestic
Madagascar lemur. Also, "lemur" sounds like my first and last
name mashed together quickly.

But there exist many other fanciful
[math](/assets/names/math_terms.txt)-[animal](/assets/names/animals.txt)
combinations to be had. Here you can generate your very own!

<script src="/assets/names/gen_name.js"></script>
<button onclick="gen_name()">Generate</button>
<strong id="display_name">FluxLemur</strong>

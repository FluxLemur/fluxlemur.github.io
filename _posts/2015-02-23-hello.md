## Hello Internet World

And so this website finally sees the light of day; it is [quite
operational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGwDwx10wB4).

But what is the meaning of FluxLemur? It is a wonderful combination of an
applied math concept, "the flow of a physical property in space"
([Flux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux)), and the majestic
Madagascar lemur. 

But there exist many other fanciful
[math](/assets/names/math_terms.txt)-[animal](/assets/names/animals.txt)
combinations to be had. Here you can generate your very own!

<button onclick="gen_name()">Generate</button>
